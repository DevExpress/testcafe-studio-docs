    I want to test web applications using TestCafe. What do I buy?
</h4>
<div class="hide">
<p>If you are using <a href="/" title="TestCafe" target="_blank">TestCafe</a> to test "for profit" or "commercial" websites or applications, you must purchase a 12 month subscription from DevExpress or its authorized resellers for each user/tester. When you purchase a 12 month subscription to TestCafe, you receive 12 months of major and minor updates for each licensed product from the date of purchase.</p>
<p>After the 12 month period and at your discretion, you can pay 45% of the original price to "renew" the subscription and receive another 12 months of free updates. If you choose not to renew, you can continue using the last version you obtained or are eligible to use. The 12 month time frame is merely for new versions/updates and has no relevance to rights of use (as long as the <a href="/EULA">EULA</a> is not violated).</p>
<p>Note that you can renew a subscription after it has expired. Renewal costs increase 30 days after expiration of your subscription (pricing increases on a monthly basis after the 13th month). Please contact the <a href="mailto:ClientServices@devexpress.com">DevExpress Client Services Team</a> if you have an expired subscription or if you need further clarification on the terms of our subscription.</p>

    Can I evaluate TestCafe before I purchase a commercial license?
</h4>
<div class="hide">
<p>Yes, you can download and evaluate TestCafe for a period of 30 days. During your 30-day trial, you are entitled to free technical support via the <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center">DevExpress Support Center</a>.</p>

    My company is interested in TestCafe. Do you license per user/tester or per machine?
</h4>
<div class="hide">
<p>DevExpress licenses its products on a per user/tester basis. Each user/tester that uses our testing products must be licensed and therefore must purchase a license. We don't license per machine or per server. For more information, you can read our <a href="/EULA">End-User License Agreement</a>. Because we license TestCafe per user/tester, additional licenses are not required to install TestCafe onto a continuous integration server in order to run tests.</p>
</div>

<h4 class="switcher">
    <span class="switcher-icon sprite"></span>
    Do you offer multi user/tester discounts?
</h4>
<div class="hide">
<p>Yes, We offer tiered discounts when purchasing more than one license for your test team. Multi-User discounts are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>2-5 Licenses: 10% discount</li>
<li>6-10 Licenses: 15% discount</li>
</ul>
<p>If you require more than 10 licenses for your team, contact us by email at <a href="mailto:info@devexpress.com">info@devexpress.com</a>, chat with us online or call us at +1 (818) 844-3383 between 7:30AM and 4:30PM Pacific Time.</p>
</div>

<h4 class="switcher">
    <span class="switcher-icon sprite"></span>
    Can we transfer licenses if a user/tester leaves my company?
</h4>
<div class="hide">
<p>Yes. In fact you can do this yourself using our website once the company has purchased more than one license. Log in to the DevExpress website and select <b>My Account | Manage &amp; Assign Licenses</b> where you can assign a particular license to a given email address (that's how we differentiate between users/testers).</p>

    What avenues of support do you provide? What's the response time? How long does support last?
</h4>
<div class="hide">
<p>Support is provided by one of two methods: either by a web-based system we call the <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/" title="Support Center" target="_blank">Support Center</a>, or by email (<a href="mailto:support@devexpress.com" title="support@devexpress.com">support@devexpress.com</a>). We aim to respond to all questions within one business day.</p>
<p>Support is only provided to a user/tester with a valid commercial use license. If you have an active 12 month commercial use license, you will be entitled to technical support from a member of our technical support team.</p>
