            <h2>TestCafe Advantage #1</h2>
            <h3>A plugin-free testing environment</h3>

            <p>
                Traditional HTML&nbsp;5 web testing tools force you to&nbsp;install browser plugins so&nbsp;you can record and/or execute tests. At&nbsp;first glance, this might not seem like a&nbsp;big deal but in&nbsp;today's BYOD world, the problems associated with plugins are real and quite challenging to&nbsp;overcome.
            </p>
            
            <h6>The limitations of&nbsp;testing frameworks based on&nbsp;browser plugins</h6>
            <p>
                To&nbsp;run tests with competing web testing tools, you must download, install and configure plugins for each browser you wish to&nbsp;test against. Let's assume for a&nbsp;moment that you wish to&nbsp;test your HTML&nbsp;5 application on&nbsp;IE9, IE10, Chrome, Opera and Safari. Before recording your first test, you must obtain and install the appropriate plugins/drivers on&nbsp;your computer. So&nbsp;far so&nbsp;good (let's ignore the fact that installing all these plugins is&nbsp;a&nbsp;real pain-in-the-neck)...
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, imagine for a&nbsp;moment that Microsoft, Google or&nbsp;Apple update their browser and your plugin fails to&nbsp;work properly (Those who've used web testing know that this reality is&nbsp;unavoidable... plugins can fail when new versions of&nbsp;a&nbsp;browser are released). At&nbsp;this point, your choices are limited&nbsp;— either you ignore the new browser or&nbsp;you wait for your tool vendor to&nbsp;create an&nbsp;updated plugin for you to&nbsp;use. When you finally obtain a&nbsp;properly working plugin from the vendor, you will of&nbsp;course need to&nbsp;repeat the installation process once again on&nbsp;all your test machines.
            </p>
            <p>
                Other issues to&nbsp;consider when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;plugins:
            </p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>What happens when you have to&nbsp;test against 2&nbsp;different versions of&nbsp;the same browser? Do&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;install a&nbsp;complete test environment on&nbsp;an&nbsp;entirely different machine (real or&nbsp;virtual)?</li>
                <li>What happens with non-standard browsers? For instance, Safari on&nbsp;the iPhone is&nbsp;not the same as&nbsp;WebView. Kindle's browser is&nbsp;not the same as&nbsp;Chrome.</li>
                <li>What's the future hold (Tizen Watch browser, Google Glass and Raspberry&nbsp;Pi) and how will your plugins fit&nbsp;in?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Do&nbsp;you really want to&nbsp;risk mission-critical apps and your&nbsp;QA processes to&nbsp;products that require plugins, with all their inherent limitations?
            </p>
            
            <h6>Escape from «plugin hell» forever, with TestCafe</h6>
            <p>
                We&nbsp;believe software that forces you to&nbsp;install and maintain a&nbsp;vast array of&nbsp;plugins is&nbsp;inherently flawed, as&nbsp;it&nbsp;places an&nbsp;unreasonable burden on&nbsp;you. If&nbsp;you've tried web testing tools in&nbsp;the past or&nbsp;are using one now, chances are you've already experienced these nightmares firsthand.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, how is&nbsp;TestCafe different? It's simple really. With TestCafe, you no&nbsp;longer worry about plugins. It&nbsp;simply works, out-of-the-box. No&nbsp;plugins to&nbsp;install and no&nbsp;plugins to&nbsp;configure. You won't run into browser versioning issues and you can test on&nbsp;different versions of&nbsp;the same browser without the need to&nbsp;install a&nbsp;complete test environment. For instance, if&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;test against different versions of&nbsp;IE, you need only specify the browser on&nbsp;another computer/virtual machine/mobile device as&nbsp;a&nbsp;remote worker and then execute your test scripts. TestCafe makes testing painless and hassle free.

            <h2>TestCafe Advantage #2</h2>
            <h3>A test recorder that works with any browser: locally and on remote machines</h3>

            <p>
                If&nbsp;you've read TestCafe Advantage #1, you already know the issues related to&nbsp;plugins. If&nbsp;you've used competing testing tools, you also know that test recorders are just plugins. Since we&nbsp;don't want to&nbsp;repeat all the issues associated with plugins in&nbsp;this section, let&nbsp;us get to&nbsp;the point and tell you what you can do&nbsp;with TestCafe's Test Recorder.
            </p>
            <p>
                First, our test recorder works on&nbsp;any HTML&nbsp;5 browser and does not require installation of&nbsp;plugins. It's designed to&nbsp;make you and your team more productive and to&nbsp;help you get the job done faster than any other product of&nbsp;its kind on&nbsp;the market today.
            </p>
            
            <h6>A&nbsp;plugin free test recorder, however, is&nbsp;just the tip of&nbsp;the iceberg...</h6>
            <p>
                Let's take a&nbsp;look at&nbsp;a&nbsp;common use-case scenario within an&nbsp;enterprise to&nbsp;help explain the profound difference between TestCafe and competing products.
            </p>
            <p>
                A&nbsp;colleague contacts you and informs you that a&nbsp;user has encountered a&nbsp;problem and that the issue can be&nbsp;reproduced. With competing products, you are going to&nbsp;have to&nbsp;step in&nbsp;and deal with the matter first-hand. You are going to&nbsp;have to&nbsp;reproduce the issue yourself so&nbsp;you can both understand the problem and create regression tests for future use.
            </p>
            <p>
                Though you can follow the same steps with TestCafe and record the test yourself, you don't have&nbsp;to. Because of&nbsp;TestCafe's remote test recording capabilities, you can instead provide your colleague a&nbsp;URL (to&nbsp;the TestCafe Control Panel on&nbsp;your machine) and tell them to&nbsp;record the steps necessary to&nbsp;reproduce the issue on&nbsp;his or&nbsp;her machine. No&nbsp;need to&nbsp;worry about complicated installations of&nbsp;a&nbsp;complete test environment: your co-worker can get to&nbsp;work and in&nbsp;seconds reproduce the issue for you.
            </p>
            <p>
                The beauty of&nbsp;this is&nbsp;that you'll get a&nbsp;new regression test with no&nbsp;work on&nbsp;your part.

                And remember, with competing products, you are likely going to&nbsp;have to&nbsp;purchase a&nbsp;license for other users should you be&nbsp;willing to&nbsp;put up&nbsp;with all the hassles associated with plugins. With TestCafe, your co-worker won't require a&nbsp;license.

            <h2>TestCafe Advantage #3</h2>
            <h3>A powerful, concise and easy-to-learn API</h3>

            <p>
                We've told you about plug-ins and test recording. Let's now turn our attention to&nbsp;the ugly little secret of&nbsp;testing tools... the API. No&nbsp;matter how well designed a&nbsp;product&nbsp;is, how much it&nbsp;costs, how well it&nbsp;can visually record tests, at&nbsp;some point, you are going to&nbsp;have to&nbsp;interact with the tool by&nbsp;using its API and by&nbsp;extension, master the details of&nbsp;that API to&nbsp;get your job done.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first thing to&nbsp;notice about TestCafe's API when compared to&nbsp;other web testing tools is&nbsp;its simplicity.
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="/Documentation/ApiReference/Test_Fixture_API_Reference" target="_blank">TestCafe API</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Now compare our API to&nbsp;any of&nbsp;our competitors and judge for yourself. Which API is&nbsp;simpler, more intuitive, easier to&nbsp;understand, and most importantly the one you would like to&nbsp;use on&nbsp;a&nbsp;daily basis?
            </p>
            <p>
                If&nbsp;you are like most, you want a&nbsp;straightforward API that does not require lots of&nbsp;time and resources to&nbsp;master, and if&nbsp;this is&nbsp;you, odds are TestCafe is&nbsp;the right choice for your testing needs.
            </p>
            <p>
                By&nbsp;the way, don't let the brevity of&nbsp;our API fool you. A&nbsp;concise API does not equal lack of&nbsp;functionality. You can do&nbsp;everything you need with TestCafe without the steep learning curve and without being forced to&nbsp;learn a&nbsp;complex API.
            </p>
            <p>
                At&nbsp;this point you might be&nbsp;asking yourself how&nbsp;— how can TestCafe's API be&nbsp;so&nbsp;simple yet so&nbsp;powerful? The answer is&nbsp;that TestCafe's API is&nbsp;concise because tests are executed within the browser as&nbsp;common&nbsp;JS code, which means you already have full access to&nbsp;any standard JS/DOM API. Competing products do&nbsp;not have this capability and so&nbsp;they must write wrappers to&nbsp;call DOM API indirectly, via&nbsp;— you guessed it&nbsp;— their plugins and devices.
            </p>
            <p>
                Oh&nbsp;and one more reason why our API is&nbsp;so&nbsp;straightforward: With TestCafe you do&nbsp;not need to&nbsp;write lots of&nbsp;boilerplate code to&nbsp;prepare your test environment (such as&nbsp;manually cleaning up&nbsp;cookies, waiting for xhr request and page load). It's ALL automatic with TestCafe.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">

            <h2>TestCafe Advantage #4</h2>
            <h3>100% web based testing environment</h3>

            <p>
                Unlike competing products, TestCafe does not pretend to&nbsp;be&nbsp;something it's not. TestCafe is&nbsp;not built to&nbsp;test Windows client apps. It&nbsp;does not pretend to&nbsp;test native iOS apps. TestCafe was engineered from ground up&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;fully optimized web testing tool for web developers and&nbsp;QA engineers.
            </p>
            <p>
                TestCafe carries no&nbsp;baggage and has no&nbsp;legacy code to&nbsp;restrict it&nbsp;from helping you test your web applications across all major HTML&nbsp;5 browsers&nbsp;— on&nbsp;the desktop and on&nbsp;mobile devices such as&nbsp;the iPad or&nbsp;Android tablets.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you start using TestCafe within your organization, you'll discover that the entire&nbsp;QA process&nbsp;— from writing, recording, editing and deleting test scripts to&nbsp;test execution and result analysis&nbsp;— can be&nbsp;managed within a&nbsp;browser both locally or&nbsp;on&nbsp;remote computers.
            </p>
            <p>
                How important is&nbsp;the ability to&nbsp;test locally and on&nbsp;remote computers? We've already described how your colleagues can assist you to&nbsp;write regression tests without installing a&nbsp;testing environment but that's just one example. Another is&nbsp;that with TestCafe (and our flexible licensing model), you can install a&nbsp;single instance of&nbsp;TestCafe on&nbsp;your server and access it&nbsp;from anywhere in&nbsp;the world and get your job done without wasting time on&nbsp;configuration or&nbsp;wasting money on&nbsp;overpriced remote server licenses.

            <h2>TestCafe Advantage #5</h2>
            <h3>Easy-to-write and easy-to-understand test code</h3>

            <p>
                TestCafe's code structure is&nbsp;designed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;human readable and written using the language of&nbsp;the web&nbsp;— JavaScript. With TestCafe, your tests are as&nbsp;clean and simple as&nbsp;possible&nbsp;— each line corresponding to&nbsp;an&nbsp;end-user action without any cycles or&nbsp;branches. You will never have to&nbsp;write test code that deals with browser complexities&nbsp;— such as&nbsp;waiting for elements to&nbsp;load, scrolling the page to&nbsp;make the element visible, manually determining whether the element is&nbsp;actually visible, etc. All these auxiliary actions are performed automatically so&nbsp;your test code is&nbsp;easy to&nbsp;read and analyze.
            </p>
            <p>
                QA&nbsp;engineers will tell you that test code is&nbsp;by&nbsp;its nature different than production code. The reason is&nbsp;simple: test code is&nbsp;«write once» and «reference again only when problems are encountered» code. As&nbsp;such, when an&nbsp;issue is&nbsp;discovered, testers need to&nbsp;quickly determine the cause and reproducible steps without wasting time analyzing what the test code is&nbsp;doing.
            </p>
            <p>
                TestCafe tests are split into steps: with only a&nbsp;single test action and with descriptive language. The result is&nbsp;that&nbsp;QA engineers and developers alike can simply read the test code and get to&nbsp;the heart of&nbsp;the problem without wasting time on&nbsp;test code analysis. And of&nbsp;course, this degree of&nbsp;code clarity extends to&nbsp;our visual test record since it&nbsp;also automatically generates descriptions that are easy to&nbsp;understand.
            </p>
            <p>
                The easiest way to&nbsp;understand the benefit of&nbsp;Advantage #5&nbsp;is simply to&nbsp;try TestCafe, record a&nbsp;test script and view its output then compare it&nbsp;to&nbsp;other web testing tools. Odds are that our competitors will generate highly complex output with a&nbsp;mess of&nbsp;code and cycles. Take for instance the following test script code... Though you may not have written&nbsp;it, you'll find that its purpose is&nbsp;instantly identifiable.
            </p>

            <pre><code class="javascript">'@test'['Do not allow users to enter invalid e-mails'] = {
    'Initially, the element for incorrect e-mail info is hidden': function () {
        notOk($('#Email_Error').is(':visible'));
    },
    'Type incorrect e-mail': function () {
        act.type($('#Email'), 'test@test_com');
    },
    'Leave the e-mail input': function () {
        act.press('tab');
    },
    'The warning about incorrect e-mail should be visible now': function () {
        ok($('#Email_Error').is(':visible'));
    }
};
            </code></pre>

            <p>
                And remember, this exact code will work for all major web technologies:
            </p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Postbacks</li>
                <li>AJAX callbacks</li>
                <li>Client JavaScript</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Whether you execute the code on&nbsp;the server and obtain results via AJAX callbacks or&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;directly on&nbsp;the client in&nbsp;JavaScript or&nbsp;even perform a&nbsp;postback, TestCafe manages everything internally (waits for the AJAX request, reloads state after a&nbsp;postback, etc).
            </p>
            <p>
                With TestCafe, the bottom line is&nbsp;simple... your test code is&nbsp;clean and is&nbsp;never dependent upon the technology you wish to&nbsp;use. Just compare our implementation to&nbsp;those of&nbsp;our competitors. The reason competing tools require such complexity is&nbsp;because they force you to&nbsp;write/manage lots of&nbsp;boilerplate code. Just try it&nbsp;with your existing web testing tool: Go&nbsp;from postbacks to&nbsp;AJAX callbacks or&nbsp;from AJAX to&nbsp;client JavaScript, and see what happens to&nbsp;your tests. Odds are you will be&nbsp;forced to&nbsp;re-write the test as&nbsp;they will simply stop working. Now who wants to&nbsp;deal with all of&nbsp;that?
            </p>
            <p>
                TestCafe is&nbsp;better by&nbsp;design. Your test code knows nothing about postbacks or&nbsp;callbacks because TestCafe's engine automatically handles these complexities internally so&nbsp;you don't have&nbsp;to. How's that for awesome.
