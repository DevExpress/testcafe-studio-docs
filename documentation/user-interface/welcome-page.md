The page allows you to perform the following tasks:

* [Start Recording a Test](#start-recording-a-test)
* [Open a Test Directory](#open-a-test-directory)
* [Open Recent Directories](#open-recent-directories)
* [Open Examples](#open-examples)

## Start Recording a Test

Enter a tested site's URL to the page's input field and click the ![Start recording a test](../../images/guides/record-test-icon.png) **Start recording a test** button to start the recording. TestCafe Studio creates a test, launches a browser with the tested site and starts recording your activity on the webpage. TestCafe Studio adds your actions to the test. You can view the test in the [Test Editor](test-editor.md).

## Open a Test Directory

To open a directory in TestCafe Studio, click the **Open Directory** button and navigate to the directory. TestCafe Studio opens the directory and shows its content in the [Explorer](explorer-panel.md) panel.

## Open Recent Directories

The page lists recently opened test directories. Click a desired directory in the list to open it in TestCafe Studio. You can view the directory's content in the [Explorer](explorer-panel.md) panel.

## Open Examples

Click **Open Examples** to open the test directory with example tests.

## Navigate to Documentation and Video Tutorials

The page also provides links to TestCafe Studio documentation and [video tutorials](../video-tutorials/README.md).
