# Code Editor

The **Code Editor** allows you to write and modify [coded tests](../guides/organize-tests.md#coded-test-files). To open the editor, double-click a test file's node or a test's node in the [Explorer](explorer-panel.md) panel. If you create a new test file (see [Write Test Code](../guides/write-test-code.md)), TestCafe Studio automatically opens the file in the editor.

You can write coded tests using JavaScript or TypeScript. For information about the API used in tests, see the [Test API](https://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/documentation/test-api/) topic in the open-source TestCafe documentation.

The **Code Editor** provides the following code edit features: syntax highlight, code completion, parameter hints, bracket matching, go to definition, peek definition and so on.

The editor also provides the ![Run test button](../../images/user-interface/run-target-icon.svg) buttons that allow you to run an entire fixture and individual tests. These buttons are shown in the gutter for lines that define fixtures and tests.
