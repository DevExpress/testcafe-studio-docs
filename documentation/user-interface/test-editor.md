To open the desired test in the Test editor, double-click the test in the Explorer panel or click it in the Fixture editor.

When you [create an empty test](../../working-with-testcafe-studio/recording-tests/README.md#creating-tests) or start [recording a new test](../../working-with-testcafe-studio/recording-tests/README.md#starting-and-stopping-recording), TestCafe Studio automatically opens this test in the Test editor.

The main area of the editor contains actions .

You can add actions to the test, modify and delete actions, and change actions' order.

The Test editor consists of two parts:

* Main area - Contains actions that make up the current test.
