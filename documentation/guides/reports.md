# Reports

You can view test results in the [Reports panel](../user-interface/reports-panel.md). Each row in the panel corresponds to an individual test run. The test run can contain a single test, a group of tests from different fixtures, fixture tests or directory tests.

You can view the following information for each test run: the progress, start time, duration and the number of tests that have failed and passed. Different colors indicates the test's status: green - passed tests, red - failed tests.

![Reports Panel](../../images/guides/reports-panel.png)

You can click the test run's row in the **Reports** panel to see detailed results. This opens the [Report view](../user-interface/report-view.md) with a full report that contains the overall results and details for each executed test. You can see additional information for failed tests: failed actions, what caused them, links to these actions and screenshots.

![Report Tab](../../images/guides/report-tab.png)

You can sort, group and filter the data. You can also view the report in various formats and export it. See [Report view](../user-interface/report-view.md) for more information.
