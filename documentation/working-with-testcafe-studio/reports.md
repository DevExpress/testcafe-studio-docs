# Reports

You can view results for all executed test runs in the **Reports** panel. Each row in the panel corresponds to an individual test run (it can be a single test, a fixture's test run or an entire directory's test run) and contains the following information: the test run's progress, start time, duration and the number of tests that have failed and passed. Different colors indicates the test run status: green - passed tests, red - failed tests, blue - running and pending tests.

To see the detailed results, click the test run's row in the **Reports** panel. This will open the **Report tab** with a full report in the **Grid** format.
The report contains overall results and details for each executed test. These details include failed actions data, links to these actions, screenshots and so on.

You can sort, group and filter the data. Also, you can view the report in various formats and export it. For more information, see the description of the **Report Tab**.
