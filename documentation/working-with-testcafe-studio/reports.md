# Reports

You can view results for all test runs in the **Reports** panel. Each row in the panel corresponds to an individual test run. The test run can contain a single test, a group of tests from different fixtures, fixture tests or directory tests.

For each test run, you can view the following information: the test run's progress, start time, duration and the number of tests that have failed and passed. Different colors indicates the test run status: green - passed tests, red - failed tests, blue - running and pending tests.

To see the detailed results, click the test run's row in the **Reports** panel. This will open the **Report tab** with a full report that contains overall results and details for each executed test. For failed tests, you can see additional information: failed actions, the causes of the fails, links to these actions and screenshots.

You can sort, group and filter the data. Also, you can view the report in various formats and export it. For more information, see the description of the **Report Tab**.
