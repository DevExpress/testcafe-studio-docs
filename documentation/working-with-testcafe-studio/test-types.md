# Test Types

TestCafe Studio allows you to create two types of tests.

## Visual Tests

Visual tests consists of [test actions](creating-and-recording-tests.md#test-actions) performed with a tested page (clicks, key presses, drags, etc.). In TestCafe Studio's UI and documentation, the visual tests are called simply **tests**. You create them by recording actions or by adding actions to them manually. For more information, see [Creating and Recording Tests](creating-and-recording-tests.md).

## Coded Tests

You can also write tests in JavaScript or TypeScript. Create a .js or .ts file and write test code using a built-in code editor. For more information, see [Writing Test Code].
