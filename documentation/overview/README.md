# Overview

TestCafe Studio is a cross-platform IDE for end-to-end web testing that does not require WebDriver or other tools. It works on Windows, MacOS, and Linux, and in every popular browser.

TestCafe Studio has the following features:

* You can create, edit and maintain end-to-end tests in a visual recorder without writing code. See [Recording Tests](../working-with-testcafe-studio/recording-tests/README.md).

* Produces selectors to identify webpage elements. These selectors are generated automatically when a test is recorded.

* Provides a set of assertions which allows you to perform verifications.

* Created tests can be run on all desktop and mobile browsers (with or without a UI). See [Run Configurations](../working-with-testcafe-studio/running-tests.md#run-configurations).

* Includes a built-in waiting mechanism that automatically checks that page elements are loaded during the test run. You do not need to add timeouts manually.

* Generates a report with overall results and details for each test after they are completed. See [Reports](../working-with-testcafe-studio/reports.md).

* Contains a powerful Code Editor with syntax highlight, code completion and parameter hints. You can write code from scratch, or convert recorded tests to JavaScript to edit them later. See [Writing Test Code](../working-with-testcafe-studio/writing-test-code.md).
