# Overview

TestCafe Studio is a cross-platform IDE for end-to-end web testing. It works anywhere: on Windows, MacOS and Linux, and in every popular browser. TestCafe Studio doesn’t require WebDriver or other tools. You can install it in a couple of minutes and start testing right away.

TestCafe Studio provides advanced features that help you to test web apps fast.

* You create, edit and maintain end-to-end tests with a visual recorder, which means you don’t have to code. See [Recording Tests](../working-with-testcafe-studio/recording-tests.md).

* To identify page elements, TestCafe Studio uses selectors. You won’t need to write the selectors yourself, they’re generated during the test recording. For each page element, TestCafe Studio produces a set of selectors, so you can pick the one that fits you best.

* To check if the tested website works as expected, TestCafe Studio provides a set of assertions which allows you to perform different verifications.

* Created tests can be run in all popular browsers: desktop and mobile, the ones with UI or headless. See [Run Configurations](working-with-testcafe-studio/running-tests.md#run-configurations).

* TestCafe Studio has a built-in waiting mechanism that automatically checks that page elements are loaded during the test run. Thus, you don’t need to manually add timeouts. This helps you save time and get stable tests.

* After the tests finish, TestCafe Studio provides a report with overall results and details for each test. See [Reports](../working-with-testcafe-studio/reports.md).

* TestCafe Studio is made for users of all skill levels. The visual recorder allows creating tests without expert knowledge of JavaScript. For those who like to code, TestCafe Studio provides a powerful Code Editor with syntax highlight, code completion, parameter hints and so on. You can write code from scratch, or convert recorded tests to JavaScript code to edit them later. See [Writing Test Code](working-with-testcafe-studio/writing-test-code.md).
