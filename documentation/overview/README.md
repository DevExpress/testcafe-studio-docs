# Overview

TestCafe Studio is a cross-platform IDE for end-to-end web testing that does not require WebDriver or other tools. It works on Windows, MacOS, and Linux, and in every popular browser. You can install it in a couple of minutes and start testing right away.

TestCafe Studio provides the following features.

* You can create, edit and maintain end-to-end tests with a visual recorder without writing code. See [Recording Tests](../working-with-testcafe-studio/recording-tests.md).

* TestCafe Studio uses selectors which are generated during the test recording to identify page elements. TestCafe Studio produces a set of selectors for each page element, so you can pick the one that fits you best.

* TestCafe Studio provides a set of assertions which allows you to perform different verifications.

* Created tests can be run in all desktop and mobile browsers (with or without a UI). See [Run Configurations](working-with-testcafe-studio/running-tests.md#run-configurations).

* TestCafe Studio has a built-in waiting mechanism that automatically checks that page elements are loaded during the test run. You do not need to manually add timeouts. This helps you save time and get stable tests.

* After the tests finish, TestCafe Studio provides a report with overall results and details for each test. See [Reports](../working-with-testcafe-studio/reports.md).

* For users who like to code, TestCafe Studio provides a powerful Code Editor with syntax highlight, code completion and parameter hints. You can write code from scratch, or convert recorded tests to JavaScript to edit them later. See [Writing Test Code](working-with-testcafe-studio/writing-test-code.md).
